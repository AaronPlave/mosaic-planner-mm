TODO:

--------------Ranked in order of importance, at least for the first few---------------

++#Test 63x acquisition and write a script to modify the Micro-Manager output to match axiovision metadata output


++#Allow user to set parameters like focus settings, MM-configuration file to load, button for loading MM config?, project name for creating a project folder to store mosaic, CSV, and subfolder containing image folders, cross corr coefficient used for good match, number of slices (for determining when to stop), search window size for correllation, maybe number of searches and window sizes?

++#Icons for new functions

++#Add Z in PosList
     -Should I have PosList guess the next Z position or just leave that to autofocus?


++#Some sort of global "I'M DOING MM PROJECT" flag?
      -Done, MM_FLAG, can use for other things if necessary

#README
	-list known issues
	-mention that position list is saved in current MM format, may have to update this if mM changes

#DOCSTRINGS!!!!!!!

++#FIX mosiacPlanner pixel size grab from metadata

#Add some sort of safety features that know the extent of the stage and won't go past the edges?

------Unordered---------

#Create a settings pickle/txt file so that you don't have to set this stuff each time, maybe load this settings file at beginning or automatically load it from the MM directory?

# Z Range for autofocus/test autofocus more


#optimize cross-correlation:
	  -Threading?
	  -Smaller windows?
	  -Non-repetitive searches, i.e. rings around the middle, excluding previous region of search
	  -Make it work better the first time

++#Save a session
	-done by default
++#Reload a session
	  -need to add support for loading points back in
++#Delete an image

++#Manually (with OR without autofocus) add an image (more than just the first two), could use this after failure if not the end of ribbon

++#Have mosaic Planner NOT freeze up during acquisition

#More testing for bugs
      -bug when choosing a project folder that's already been created, have it check for existence
      -weird bug when you don't cross_corr in the beginning, but always will cross corr. so..
      -error when try to take picture at position that already has been taken

#Fix boxes/get rid of them


#64 bit compatibility. Derp.

#Backwards compatibility

#microscope stage coords resetting each time you turn off the scope....

#load points
